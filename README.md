# chrome-custom-tab-switcher
Set custom shortcuts to switch to specific tabs. Separates pinned and standard tab shortcuts.

Set Chrome to developer mode, clone/download this repo and then load package from <chrome://extensions/> page.

Next select your shortcuts from <chrome://extensions/configureCommands>. I was going to add defaults, but Chrome restricts me to 4 presets.
